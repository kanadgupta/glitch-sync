# Glitch Sync From GitHub

[![Remix on Glitch](https://cdn.glitch.com/2703baf2-b643-4da7-ab91-7ee2a2d00b5b%2Fremix-button.svg)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/import/github/kanadgupta/glitch-sync)

This action uses the [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) API to [export your GitHub repository to your Glitch project](https://glitch.com/help/import-git/).

## Requirements

- A public GitHub repository
- An existing [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) project

## Inputs

### `project-id`

**Required** The ID of your Glitch Project. You can easily obtain this by logging `process.env.PROJECT_ID` in your Glitch project. More info: https://glitch.com/help/project/

### `auth-token`

**Required** The `Authorization` request header used when clicking the **Import from GitHub** button (Tools > Import and Export > Import from GitHub) from within your Glitch project (see screenshot below). The only way that I know to obtain this is to look at your Network tab in your browser and capture the contents of the `Authorization` request header when the request to https://api.glitch.com/project/githubImport is made.

### `path`

**Optional** A relative path to a specific folder to import. If not passed, it will just import the entirety of the GitHub repository.

## Example usage

See [`.github/workflows/main.yml`](https://github.com/kanadgupta/glitch-sync/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml) for a full example.

*I strongly recommend adding the inputs as encrypted secrets instead of passing them directly into your action file! [Here](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets) are the GitHub docs on how to do this.*

```yml
uses: kanadgupta/glitch-sync@master
with:
  project-id: '${{ secrets.projectId }}'
  auth-token: '${{ secrets.authToken }}'
  path: '${{ secrets.path }}' # optional
```

## Disclaimer

I am not an employee of Glitch (just an enthusiastic user)! This repository is not endorsed by Glitch and does not use a documented public API endpoint (and the endpoint can be kind of flaky to be honest). The endpoint may change at anytime and break this workflow.
